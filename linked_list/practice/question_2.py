# 3. Implement doubly linked list. The only difference with regular linked list is that double linked has prev node reference as well. That way you can iterate in forward and backward direction. Your node class will look this this,
# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, data=None, next=None, prev=None):
#         self.data = data
#         self.next = next
#         self.prev = prev

# Add following new methods,

# def print_forward(self):
#     # This method prints list in forward direction. Use node.next

# def print_backward(self):
#     # Print linked list in reverse direction. Use node.prev for this.
